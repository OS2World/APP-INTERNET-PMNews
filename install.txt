Some notes for PMNews ---

This program is a PM replacement for SNEWS.EXE, which means that
you need the rest of Rommel's port or McCombs code plus UUPC
to comtemplate using it.

The usual disclaimer is in effect:  no warranty, expressed or
implied accompanies this code; if all your data, programs, and
power-supply are destroyed by this program, I'm not liable.

Install the .exe and .ico files in a convenient subdirectory
and create a WPS object which invokes it, specifying the residence
directory as the working directory.
In your PERSONAL.RC file, be sure that Editor and Aliases are
specified with their full path and extension.
The environment variables UUPCSYSRC, UUPCUSRRC, and UUPCNEWS
must be available (usually means set in config.sys).
The SNEWS suite of programs should be available in the config.sys
PATH.

Source code will be forthcoming if there's enough interest and
I find the time to clean up the horrible mess (first PM attempt).
It's evident that just because a program is a GUI object does not
mean that it is easier to use than a character-based application.
Knowing  what I now know of PM, a rewrite would improve this.


The program builds a .INI file after the first run, containing the
locations of the group list dialog box and article window position
and size.

You'll note that PMNews creates a file pmnews.err whenever it runs.
When an error occurs this file will contain some cryptic 'fprintf'
information relevant to the error (if we're lucky).

There is currently no useful 'unread' article behavior for the
program.  When a thread is opened, the first article is always
displayed, not the first unread.  Both approaches should be supported
perhaps via a mouse double-clicking option.

There is no font support, so system proportional is what there is.
This is particularly ugly in the mail-article listbox.

Send me e-mail for suggestions, complaints, etc.

                    pmmthrd.c is an adjustable threader, or provide a
